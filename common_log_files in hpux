/var/adm/wtmp


cat /dev/null > /var/adm/wtmp

>/var/adm/wtmp

Rather than using the commands: rm, touch, chmod, chown, chgrp in order to
create an empty file, the cat /dev/null technique retains all the
characteristics of the old file. Note that zeroing /var/adm/wtmp on a running
system may cause errors to be reported from the who command. These errors
are caused by who not finding the users currently logged in. The best way to
trim /var/adm/wtmp is to do it in single user mode. Do not zero the
/etc/utmp...this is done automaticall
