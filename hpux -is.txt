The EFI shell is different.
Typing 'hpux -is' at the 'Shell>' prompt won't boot to single user mode.

You need to get into the hpux boot loader (which I called ISL) by either using the boot manager menu or by typing 'hpux' from the EFI prompt.

It will say 'Press Any Key to interrup Autoboot'. Press a key.

Then you can use 'hpux -is' or 'boot vmunix -is' at the 'HPUX>' prompt to boot into single user mode.

Mike, the ISL prompt does not exist on Itanium machines.

From the EFI prompt, use "hpux -is".








After powering on the system will perform the Power On Self
Tests (POST) and then launch the EFI Boot Manager:
If no boot option is configured yet you may select EFI Shell [Build-in]. The device
mapping table will be displayed and the EFI shell script STARTUP.NSH will be executed:
From here you are able to switch to any other boot disk that has an EFI file system, e.g to
switch to fs1 type fs1:. In order to go back to the EFI boot manager menu type exit.
To continue, invoke the HP-UX boot loader. Itâ s an EFI executable (hpux.efi). EFI
executables (.efi) and EFI shell scripts (.nsh) can be invoked without specifying the
appendix. This is DOS like ;-)
fs2:\> hpux
Pressing any key at this point interrupts the 10 seconds autoboot timeout and invokes
the OS Loader hpux.efi in interactive mode. At the HPUX> prompt you have several
possibilities to interact, such as
Changing boot options:
HPUX> boot -is for single user mode
HPUX> boot -lq for LVM quorum mode
HPUX> boot -lm for maintenance mode boot
HPUX> boot -tm for failsave mode (no DLKMs etc,)
HPUX> boot backup for booting backup kernel configuration
HPUX> boot vmunix.prev for booting previous kernel

then system will boot normally as PA RISC
