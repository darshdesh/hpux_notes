How to extend a file system in hp-ux
lvextend -L 1500 /dev/vgxx/lvolx (assuming the final size will be 1.5GB)
fsadm -F vxfs -b 1500m /xxx     (xxx=mount point) If you have online JFS.
or
umount /xxx
extendfs -F vxfs /dev/vgxx/rlvolx
 
How to create a patch depot
swcopy -s /soft/patch/PHSS_35546.depot PHSS35546 @ /soft/patch/depot
 
To Display mode parameter of a SCSI Device
/usr/sbin/scsictl -a -m ir=1 -m ir /dev/rdsk/c1t15d0
 
How to create a file system
First check the available disks and minor no for the VG you want to create

ll /dev/*/group ( Will look like this)
crw-rw-r-- 1 root sys 64 0x010000 Sep 16 2006 /dev/vg-ignite/group
crw-r----- 1 root sys 64 0x000000 Sep 16 2006 /dev/vg00/group

Note down the next available minor no. In this example we can use
0x020000 (0x for hex then 02 is for VG and next 0000 is reserved for logical volumes)

mkdir /dev/vg-test
mknod /dev/vg-test/group c 64 0x02000
vgcreate /dev/vg-test /dev/dsk/c1t15d0 (assuming on this disk you want to create VG)
then
lvcreate -r n -L 20480 -n lv-TEST /dev/vg-TEST (assuming 20GB LV Size you want)
newfs -F fxfs -o largefiles /dev/vg-test/rlv-test
mount /dev/vg-test/lv-test /test
 
To check the contents of a Itanium based Systems make_tape_recovery do the following. you use -xvf to restore any file too.
mt -t /dev/rmt/0mn rew
mt -t /dev/rmt/0mn fsf 22
tar -tvf /dev/rmt/0mn
 
Find the list of files in a bundle.
First find the Bundle name from the Depot
swlist -l bundle -s /patch/11.00/depot
Then
swlist -l file -l bundle -s/patch/11.00/depot PB_11_00_march_2003
 
How to make a Software package
First swcopy to a depot
then 
Ex. Assuming the the depot is /patch/11.00/depot
Create the bundle first
make_bundles -B i -n "PB_11_00_march_2003" -t "Patch Database March 2003" \
-o /patch/11.00/depot/PB_March_2003_11.00.psf   -r 1.0 /patch/11.00/depot

then run 

swpackage -s /patch/11.00/PB_March-2003_11.00.psf  -xlayout_version=1.0 -xreinstall_files=true \
-d /patch/11.00/depot
 
To unregister a CD-ROM depot mounted at /mnt/cd, you would type:
swreg -l depot -u /mnt/cd

To register the same depot (mounted at /mnt/cd on the local host) as a depot to be available on the network, type:
swreg -l depot /mnt/cd

The following example enables direct access from one or two other systems to the HWEnable11i depot on the Support Plus CD, assuming the Support Plus CD is mounted at /cdrom:

swreg -l depot /cdrom/HWEnable11i0.
 
SCSI Tuning in HP-UX
scsictl -a /dev/rdsk/c4t6d0 -- too see the parameters
scsictl -m queue_depth=32 /dev/rdsk/c4t6d0 - to change from default 8k to 32k
scsictl -c get_lun_parms /dev/rdsk/cxtxdx does the same as scsictl -a

to set the immediate report on and display all mode parameters
scsictl -a -m ir=1 -m ir /dev/rdsk/c4t6d0

to make the changes permanent
kctune

to see the scsi_max-q_depth settings run 
kctune scsi_max_qdepth

to change it from default 8 to desired 32k permanently 
kctune scsi_max_qdepth=32 and type y when it asks for confirmation

Basic instructions, for setting up a HPUX dhcp client
a) The name resolution for localhost/loopback must work without any network. So:
 /etc/hosts
 127.0.0.1 localhost loopback
 /etc/nsswitch.conf
 hosts: files [NOTFOUND=continue] dns

b) Setup the rc-config file for dhcp:
/etc/rc.config.d/netconf:
HOSTNAME=""
PERATING_SYSTEM=HP-UX
LOOPBACK_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
INTERFACE_NAME[0]=lan0
IP_ADDRESS[0]=
SUBNET_MASK[0]=255.255.255.255
BROADCAST_ADDRESS[0]=""
INTERFACE_STATE[0]=""
DHCP_ENABLE[0]=1
GATED=0
GATED_ARGS=""
RDPD=0
RARP=0
PAY ATTENTION: In this file the hostname ist NOT set, the subnetmask is set to 255.255.255.255 and all route entries are removed!

c) Remove all files, that start with dhcp
rm /etc/dhcp*

d) create a blank /etc/dhcpclient.data with permissions 644:
touch /etc/dhcpclient.data
chmod 644 /etc/dhcpclient.data

e) in /etc/inetd.conf comment the line which starts with "bootps"
 
f) Create a rc file, that blanks out the /etc/dhcpclient.data at each shutdown. The link should be a K-Link in /sbin/rc0.d/ (For instructions how to create a working rc script see /sbin/init.d/template)

How to create a robotic device for Veritas netbackup difficult way :

Steps to create a device file manually for Robot for Veritas netbackup
ioscan -fnk|grep for the controller the robot has connecetd
Note down the Ext Bus Card instance no.
Example :
We have a IBM 3581 Scaller Library Connected to SCSI LVD Card at Hardware Address 0/0/1/0 .SCSI ID of the Library is 14, LUN no. of the Robot is 1 and the drive LUN no. is 0

Now if we run ioscan -fnk|egrep -i '0/0/1/0' and look for the line c8xx and interface the Instance no. in column I (2nd column) shows the instance as 0. now run and the results are
lsdev |grep -i sctl
203 -1 sctl ctl
We need the major no which is 203 from here. Now we have all required information we need.
mknod /dev/sctl/c0t14d1 c 203 0x00e100

c0=controller 0 i.e. 0/0/1
t14 = SCSI ID14 of the Library
d1 = LUN No 1 ( Lun no. of the robot is 1 in this case)

203 = major no we got from lsdev output
minor no follows this format
0xiitl0o
Now lets explain here
0x= Standard Hex no starting
ii=00 = 0 is the Card Instance no we got from ioscan "I" Column (in case of card IN 1 it will be 01 and so forth)
t=e = 14 (hex) (target ID, SCSI ID)
L=1 = Lun no of the Robot
0 = 0 always Zero (reserved portion of Minor no. This field is always 0)
o = Operational field for the SCTl Driver

For SCTL the Values are
0 (Zero) - Normal open
1 (one) - ATN not used with select , for backward compatibility
2 (two) Inhibits inquiry at open
Now You have to build a new kernel
cd /stand/build
vi /stand/system and add these two lines

sctl
driver 0/0/1/0.14.1 sctl

save and quit

/usr/sbin/mk_kernel -s /stand/system
kmupdate
reboot

 

How to create a robotic device for Veritas netbackup easy way :


For Both SCSI & Fiber Robots 

For IBM 3584 Library
Use last three characters will be 100 instead of 200 as in /dev/rac directory and major no. will be 203 (same as sctl)

The reason to change it to 100 is the robotic device is controlled by the 1st Tape Drive in the Tape partition so the robot and the drive is same device (Drive scsi/fscsi id is 0 and robot is 1 , always)
for ex. ll /dev/rac/c6t7d1 231 0x062e200
then the major and minor no for new device will be 203 and 0x062e100 respectively.
For STK L700/L180/L3000/ and Quantum ATLP4000 Libraries the minor no. will be same as the device in /dev/rac.

Now You have to build a new kernel
cd /stand/build
vi /stand/system and add these two lines

sctl
driver 0/0/1/0.14.1 sctl

save and quit

/usr/sbin/mk_kernel -s /stand/system
kmupdate
reboot

 

 Setting UP Quota on HPUX

1. Mount the file system
    mount /dev/vg01/lvol4 /home

2. cpset /dev/null /home/quotas 600 root bin

( empty file created with at the root of file system with owner root   grp bin permission for root)
3. /usr/sbin/edquota user
4. type the following to limit
    fs /home blocks ( soft = 10000, hard=12000) inodes ( soft = 200, hard = 300 )
   to set the time limit
   edquota –t username
    type following
    fs /home blocks time limit = 10.00 days, files time limit = 15.00 days
5. turn on quotas
    quotaon –v /home
6. check the file system for quota
    quotacheck /dev/vg02/lvol3
7. report the quotas
   repquota /home
8.report the summary of qwnership
   quot /home
9. report individuals
    /usr/bin/quota –v
 

VXVM Setup IN HP-UX

 

1. Run vxinstall to initialize at least one disk in rootdg.

2. Then you run vxdiskadm to add other disks

3. Create a /etc/vx/disks.exclude file if you want some disks to be excluded from vxvm

4. The files /etc/vx/cntrls.exclude and /etc/vx/disks.exclude are for the controllers and disks which will be   

    excluded to be used by vxinstall or vxdiskadm so the disks under     that controllers or the sepcified disks

    will not be included to any Disk Group. But all the other commmands will work

5. To determine whether the volume daemon is enabled, use the following
    command: vxdctl mode

6. To enable the volume daemon, use the following command:
    vxdctl enable

7. To start the vxconfigd daemon, use the following command:
    vxconfigd

8. Verify that vxiod daemons are running by entering this command:
    vxiod

9. If no vxiod daemons are currently running, start some by entering this
    command: vxiod set 10
    where 10 can be substituted by the desired number of vxiod daemons. It is recommended that at least one

    vxiod daemon exist for each CPU in the system.

Initial Setup
Step 1. Place disks under Volume Manager control.
Step 2. Create new disk groups (if you do not want to use rootdg or you want
other disk groups).
Step 3. Create volumes.
Step 4. Put file system(s) in volumes.

Options

• Designate hot-relocation spare disks.
• Add mirrors to volumes if necessary.

Maintenance

• Resize volumes and file systems.
• Add more disks/disk groups.
• Create snapshots.


vxvm Commands

To display free space in the system, use the following command:
vxdg free

To display free space for a disk group, use the following command:
vxdg -g diskgroup free

To display general information for all subdisks, use the following
command:
vxprint -st

To display complete information about a particular subdisk by using the following command:
vxprint -l subdisk_name (ex disk01)

Creating Volumes

To create a new volume by entering:
vxassist make volume_name length
(Ex. vxassist make god 4000m)

To create a new volume in a particular subdisk by entering:
vxassist make volume_name length subdisk
(Ex. vxassist make god 4000m disk02)

to create a 30 megabyte striped volume on three specific disks (disk03, disk04, and disk05), enter:
vxassist make agni 4000m layout=stripe disk03 disk04 disk05


Now create a file systems in it and mount and change /etc/fstab (HP-UX) or /etc/vfstab (Soaris)

newfs -F vxfs -o largefiles /dev/vx/rdsk/agni
mkdir /agni
mount /dev/vx/dsk/agni /agni

To move a disk between disk groups, remove the disk from one disk group and add it to the other. For example, to move the physical disk c0t3d0 (attached with the disk name disk04) from disk group rootdg
and add it to disk group mktdg, use the following commands:
vxdg rmdisk disk04
vxdg -g mktdg adddisk mktdg02=c0t3d0

To remove disk02 from rootdg, use the following command:
vxdg rmdisk disk02
If the disk has subdisks on it when you try to remove it, you will get an error message.

To remove disk02 from rootdg with chance of data loss, use the following command:
vxdg rmdisk disk02 -k


To remove it from Volume Manager control completely, as follows:
vxdisk rm devicename
(Ex. vxdisk rm c1t0d0)

 

Monitoring Free Space in VXFS


Extent fragmentation should be monitored with fsadm_vxfs(1M) or the -o s options of df_vxfs(1M).
There are three factors which can be used to determine the degree of fragmentation:
• percentage of free space in extents of less than eight blocks in length
• percentage of free space in extents of less than 64 blocks in length
• percentage of free space in extents of length 64 blocks or greater
An unfragmented file system will have the following characteristics:
• less than 1 percent of free space in extents of less than eight blocks in length
• less than 5 percent of free space in extents of less than 64 blocks in length
• more than 5 percent of the total file system size available as free extents in lengths of 64 or more blocks
A badly fragmented file system will have one or more of the following characteristics:
• greater than 5 percent of free space in extents of less than 8 blocks in length
• more than 50 percent of free space in extents of less than 64 blocks in length
• less than 5 percent of the total file system size available as free extents in lengths of 64 or more blocks
The optimal period for scheduling of extent reorganization runs can be determined by choosing a
reasonable interval, scheduling fsadm runs at the initial interval, and running the extent fragmentation
report feature of fsadm before and after the reorganization.
The “before” result is the degree of fragmentation prior to the reorganization. If the degree of
fragmentation is approaching the figures for bad fragmentation, then the interval between fsadm runs
should be reduced. If the degree of fragmentation is low, the interval between fsadm runs can be
increased.
The “after” result is an indication of how well the reorganizer is performing. The degree of fragmentation
should be close to the characteristics of an unfragmented file system. The file system may be a candidate
for expansion. (Full file systems tend to fragment and are difficult to defragment.) It is also possible that
the reorganization is not being performed at a time during which the file system in question is relatively
idle. Directory reorganization is not nearly as critical as extent reorganization, but regular directory
reorganization will improve performance. It is advisable to schedule directory reorganization for file
systems when the extent reorganization is scheduled. The following is a sample script that is run
periodically at 3:00 A.M. from cron for a
number of file systems:
outfile=/tmp/fsadm_out.&212#;/bin/date +’%m%d’&212#;
for i in /home /home2 /project /db
do
/bin/echo "Reorganizing $i"
/bin/timex fsadm -F vxfs -e -E -s $i
/bin/timex fsadm -F vxfs -s -d -D $i
done > $outfile 2>

 

How to Configure DNS


Create Primary DNS Server
1. Get your IP numbers for Primary and Secondary DNS first.
2. Create a list of host names and correspondence IP addresses in /etc/hosts file
3. #mkdir /etc/named.data
4. #cd /etc/named.data
5. Create a file named param that will be used by hosts_to_named to create DNS data files
Ex. -d boota.com
-n 192.168.3
-z 192.168.3.10
-b /etc/named.boot
-s
(-d = domain name, -n = network number, -z = configuration file for secondary server and IP no. of
primary server to download data files, -b for boot files used by named process, -s adds a name server
(NS) resource record in configuration file.
6. #hosts_to_named –f param
7. download the db.cache file from internet copy it to /etc/named.data directory
8. modify /etc/rc.config.d/namesvrs file (NAMED=1) to start named process automatically with m/c
boots
9. /sbin/init.d/named start
Create Secondary DNS Server
1. #mkdir /etc/named.data
2. copy boot.sec file as /etc/named.boot from the primary server if you don’t have much disk space.
or
copy boot.sec.save file as /etc/named.boot if you have much space to keep database file.
3. copy db.127.0.0 from the primary server to /etc/named.data directory
4. copy db.cache from the primary server to the /etc/named.data directory
5. if you want to create local database files download the remaining files from /etc/named.data from
primary server to local /etc/named.data directory.
6. update the /etc/rc.config.d/namesvrs file to start named at boot time.
7. start named using /sbin/init.d/named start
Create Caching DNS Server
1. #mkdir /etc/named.data
2. copy named.cacheonly from primary sever as /etc/named.boot
3. copy db.127.0.0 from primary server to /etc/named.data directory
4. copy db.cache from primary server to /etc/named.data directory
5. update the /etc/rc.config.d/namesvrs file to start named at boot time
6. start named /sbin/init.d/named start command
Configuring DNS client
1. edit /etc/nssswitch.conf file & enter
hosts: dns files
2. edit /etc/resolve.conf and enter the name servers
Ex. search xyz.com
nameserver 192.168.3.10
nameserver 192.168.3.12
Updating Database files on Primary Server
1. edit and update /etc/hosts file on primary server
2. # cd /etc/named.data
3. run to regenerate database files
4. # hosts_to_named -f param
5. reload using “sig_named restart” command

How to Mirror VG00 using LVM with HPUX-11.23IA
HP Document ID : KBRC00014526
NOTE: There are differences in procedure between 11.22 and 11.23.
Please refer to KBRC00011156 for B.11.22.
1. From HPUX, use vgdisplay to identify the disk that is in vg00. Use
ioscan to find the spare disk.
# vgdisplay -v --> vg00 is on /dev/dsk/c2t1d0s2 in this example
# ioscan -efunC disk --> Let's assume c3t2d0 for this example
2. Create the system, OS, and service partitions.
# vi /tmp/partitionfile
3
EFI 500MB
HPUX 100%
HPSP 400MB
# idisk -wf /tmp/partitionfile /dev/rdsk/c3t2d0
idisk version: 1.31
********************** WARNING ***********************
If you continue you may destroy all data on this disk.
Do you wish to continue(yes/no)? yes <-- Answer "yes" and not "y"
3. Create device files needed for the new partitions.
# insf -eC disk
4. Verify the partition table.
# idisk /dev/rdsk/c3t2d0
5. Verify that the device files were created properly.
# ioscan -efnC disk --> c3t2d0 is 0/1/1/1.2.0
6. Populate the /efi/hpux/ directory in the new EFI system partition.
# mkboot -e -l /dev/rdsk/c3t2d0
7. Change the auto file for the mirror to boot without quorum.
NOTE: Using "s1"
# echo "boot vmunix -lq" > /tmp/AUTO.lq
# efi_cp -d /dev/rdsk/c3t2d0s1 /tmp/AUTO.lq /EFI/HPUX/AUTO
NOTE: We assume that if we boot from the primary, the mirror is fully
functional and therefore we don't need to override quorum. Your site
might require that both disks override quorum.
9. Verify the contents of the auto file on the primary and the mirror.
NOTE: Using "s1"
# efi_cp -d /dev/rdsk/c2t1d0s1 -u /EFI/HPUX/AUTO /tmp/AUTO.pri
# efi_cp -d /dev/rdsk/c3t2d0s1 -u /EFI/HPUX/AUTO /tmp/AUTO.alt
# cat /tmp/AUTO.pri
# cat /tmp/AUTO.alt
10. Add the new partition to vg00.
NOTE: Using "s2"
# pvcreate -fB /dev/rdsk/c3t2d0s2
# vgextend vg00 /dev/dsk/c3t2d0s2
11. Mirror all logical volumes in vg00.
NOTE: Using "s2"
# lvextend -m 1 /dev/vg00/lvol1 /dev/dsk/c3t2d0s2
# lvextend -m 1 /dev/vg00/lvol2 /dev/dsk/c3t2d0s2
# lvextend -m 1 /dev/vg00/lvol3 /dev/dsk/c3t2d0s2
.
.
.
# lvextend -m 1 /dev/vg00/lvol8 /dev/dsk/c3t2d0s2
12. Add the new disk to /stand/bootconf.
NOTE: Using "s2"
# vi /stand/bootconf
l /dev/dsk/c2t1d0s2
l /dev/dsk/c3t2d0s2
13. Verify that the new disk was added to vg00, and the lv's are in
sync.
# vgdisplay -v vg00
14. Verify that the BDRA was updated properly. Take note of the HW
paths forstep 15.
# lvlnboot -v
15. Add EFI primary and high availability boot path menu entries.
# setboot -p 0/1/1/0.1.0 <-- Set primary disk
# setboot -h 0/1/1/1.2.0 <-- Set mirror disk
# setboot -b on <-- Set autoboot on
16. Verify that the primary and mirror boot paths are configured
properly.
# setboot
17. Test the new mirror by booting off of it.
# shutdown -r -y 0
18. Select "HP-UX HA Alternate Boot" to test the mirror.
EFI Boot Manager ver 1.10 [14.61] Firmware ver 2.21 [4334]

INQ displaying devices as ACCESS DENIED (from EMC)

Use rmsf command to remove the entries (Cause:  Migrated from old Symmetrix to a new Symmetrix)

 

Host cannot see more than 8 luns per port ( From EMC)

For HP-UX hosts with HDS 9960 or HP XP512 arrays: Set the host mode to 03, not 08, as the HDS documentation specifies. Setting the host mode to 03 enables the host to see more than 8 LUNs per port.

How to test if PowerPath is load balancing and configured properly to failover (emc87060)
The following procedure can be used to make sure that PowerPath is configured properly for load balancing and failover. This example was done on an HP-UX machine, but it will work (with modifications for the device names) on any Unix host:

Pick a Symmetrix device and note all of the native paths configured for that device:

# powermt display dev=c24t0d1
Symmetrix ID=000187400662
Logical device ID=0011
state=alive; policy=SymmOpt; priority=0; queued-IOs=0
================================================
---------------- Host --------------- - Stor - -- I/O Path - -- Stats ---
### HW Path I/O Paths Interf. Mode State Q-IOs Errors
================================================
24 0/10/0/0.97.32.19.0.0.1 c24t0d1 FA 13aA active alive 0 0
35 0/12/0/0.97.32.19.0.0.1 c35t0d1 FA 13aA active alive 0 0
37 0/10/0/0.97.29.19.0.0.1 c37t0d1 FA 4bA active alive 0 0
38 0/12/0/0.97.29.19.0.0.1 c38t0d1 FA 4bA active alive 0 0

Set the policy to Round Robin for that device:

# powermt set policy=rr dev=c24t0d1
# powermt display dev=c24t0d1 | grep policy

Start I/O to a single device in the group (in this case, use the block device as the input file and /dev/null as the output file to read from the device):

# dd if=/dev/dsk/c24t0d1 of=/dev/null

Show I/O on all of the paths to that device:

# sar -d 10

Note: In the above example, there is only I/O down the four paths to device 0011 and to the internal disk (c1t2d0). If there is I/O to many devices on the system (almost certain in a production environment), egrep can be used to display only the paths to the Symm device in question:

# sar -d 10 | egrep "c24t0d1|c35t0d1|c37t0d1|c38t0d1"

How to interpret HP-UX device numbers from SCSI read and write errors in the syslog - emc88252
When SCSI read and write errors are logged in the syslog, the device number is written in hex. For example:
Jun 2 21:13:38 pdb01 vmunix: SCSI: Read error -- dev: b 31 0x2b8400, errno: 126, resid: 8192,
Jun 2 21:13:39 pdb01 above message repeats 13 times
Jun 2 21:13:39 pdb01 vmunix: - dev: b 31 0x2b8400, errno: 126, resid: 8192,
Jun 2 21:13:39 pdb01 vmunix: blkno: 2895352, sectno: 5790704, offset: -1330126848, bcount: 8192.
Jun 2 21:13:52 pdb01 vmunix: SCSI: Write error -- dev: b 31 0x038400, errno: 126, resid: 8192,
Jun 2 21:13:52 pdb01 vmunix: blkno: 5454416, sectno: 10908832, offset: 1290354688, bcount: 8192.
The numbers can be broken down as follows:
vmunix: SCSI: Write error -- dev: b 31 0x2b8400
2b = Controller 43
8 = Target 8
4 = LUN 4
This translates to c43t8d4
vmunix: SCSI: Read error -- dev: b 31 0x038400
03= Controller 3
8 = Target 8
4 = LUN 4
This translates to c3t8d4

 

There is another very easy way to find it : (my note). SCSI write error is most probably either disk or tape. In this case major no is 31 which is always for disk in hp-ux. So run ll /dev/dsk and grep for the entry 0x038400 and you will know right away which is the device.

 

There are 2 paths to the same Symmetrix device (091) that is logging the read and write errors:
/dev/rdsk/c3t8d4 :EMC :SYMMETRIX :5568 :32091000 :8838720
/dev/rdsk/c43t8d4 :EMC :SYMMETRIX :5568 :32091000 :8838720
In most cases when this type of error is seen against Symm devices, the issue is logical corruption and running
fsck on the affected logical volumes or devices will solve the problem.

How to export and import a Volume Group

 

From the source Server do the these steps
unmount the filesystem(s) of the VG you want to export
umount /test (Ex. /test is the mount point)
vgchange -a n vg-test
vgexport -p -m vg-test.map vgtest (To preview and create the mapfile. To export omit -p)
on the New Server
ioscan –fnC disk (To find new disk entries)
insf –d sdisk (To install the disk device files)
ll /dev/*/group (To see what minor numbers have already been used)
mkdir /dev/vg-test (To create the directory)
mknod /dev/vgx/group c 64 0x00000 (To create the device file)
vgimport -m /dev/dsk/cxtxdx /dev/dsk/cxtxdx (To import the volume group)

How to use  linkloop command

Suppose you want to troubleshoot network problem and you have the mac address of the remote server running hp-ux. From your current server u want to check the connectivity using lan0. From ioscan -funClan you got the instance no. which is 0 and MAC of the remote ethernet card is 0x00306EF3FDBD. the syntax will be:

linkloop -vi 0 0x00306EF3FDBD

 

If swinstall, swlist or SAM takes very long time to come back

Check /etc/hosts file and match the hostname with proper IP address. Then check  /etc/resolv.conf file and check the correct entries and see if you can ping the dns server or not. For instant solution you may rename it and then run swagentd -r command. Once you are done u can move that file back and rerun swagentd -r again.

 

To check any Tape Library and Optical Jukebox

# ioscan –funCautoch ( And note down the device name with path)
Ex. /dev/rac/cxtxdx

# mc –p /dev/rac/cxtxdx –r IDSM ( Will show all the slot and Drive information)
# mc –p /dev/rac/cxtxdx –e IDSM ( Will show less detailed information)

To find the tapes in the slots
#mc –p /dev/rac/cxtxdx –r IDSM |grep –i full

To move Tape from a Storage slot 5 to drive 1

# mc –p /dev/rac/cxtxdx –s S5 –d D1 ( -s = Source, -d = destination)

( S= Storage Slot, D=Drives, E=Export/Import Slot, M=Media changer i.e robot)

I am not going through all the details here but will cover later. Here is couple of syntaxes

ISL>hpux -is       ----> To boot single user mode

ISL>hpux  /stand/vmunix.old  ---> To boot from the old kernel called vmunix.old

ISL>hpux -lq    ----->To override Quorum

ISL>hpux -lm   ------->To boot LVM maintenance mode.

We can type exit to go back to bch but it works only for newer servers including Superdome.

In stead let us boot from here using defaults as if we didn't press any key at bch or used bo

command from bch. Here is the complete boot process from Console. Take a close look

at each lines and you will understand things better. Depending upon different configuration

this screen will look slightly different but most of them are like this.
